Even though this is a non-functional project, as you can see, it works as part of my personal portfolio. All the properties and functionalities are available, I've created some fake accounts based on the One Piece anime, so you can find some funny text messages between the characters of that anime.
if you want to check some of the funcionalities, you can easily signup and create a new account. Otherwise you can sign in with one of the fake accounts:
Luffy, Zoro, Usoop, Nami, Sanji. just enter that name into the username input and the password is set equal to "123" for all og them.
